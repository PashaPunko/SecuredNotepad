Game theory can be explained broadly as a study of behaviour of rational beings in cooperative and non-cooperative decision making. It’s a relatively new field of science that emerged in the second half of the 20th century. Globalization of economics, advent of nuclear weaponry and emergence of computers were all major milestones in the history of humanity, and each subsequently dictated the need to formalize at least the most common trade and war strategies.
